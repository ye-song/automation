# Eventbrite-form-filling
Automating form filling with pyautogui.

If you need to automate form filling on eventbrite, you could use this script. Remember to change the placeholders in the script for the name, mobile number, email etc. You could add a variable to key in the promocode if it is required.

Note that the png files are needed together with the script as it is using image recognition to locate the buttons on your display.
