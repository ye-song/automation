Automating zoom session with pyautogui.

The mouseXY.py script is used to locate the coordinates of your mouse pointer on the screen of your machine.

The Zoom.py script is a short script used to automate the logging in to a zoom meeting session 
so you don't need to remember the meeting ID or the password to join the meeting.

You can also watch a demo of me running the two scripts at the link below.<br>
